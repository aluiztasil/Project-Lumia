#thermal quench

"""Thermal quenching refers to the decrease in luminescence efficiency at high temperatures. This phenomenon is often observed in thermoluminescent materials and can significantly affect the shape of the glow curve.

To study thermal quenching, you would typically perform a series of thermoluminescence measurements at different heating rates. By comparing the glow curves obtained at different heating rates, you can gain insights into the thermal quenching behavior of the material.

One common model for thermal quenching is the Mott-Seitz model, which assumes that the quenching is due to the thermal ionization of the recombination centers. According to this model, the luminescence efficiency (η) decreases with temperature (T) according to the equation:

η(T) = η_0 / (1 + C * exp(-E_q / (k * T)))

where η_0 is the luminescence efficiency at zero temperature, C is a constant, E_q is the quenching activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

You can fit this model to your data to determine the quenching activation energy and the constant C. Here's how you might do it in Python:"""

    popt, pcov = curve_fit(mott_seitz, T, η, p0=initial_guess)
    return popt, pcov
